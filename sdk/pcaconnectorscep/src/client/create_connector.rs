A general-purpose connector is designed to work with clients or endpoints that support the SCEP protocol, except Connector for SCEP for Microsoft Intune. With connectors for general-purpose use, you manage SCEP challenge passwords using Connector for SCEP. For information about considerations and limitations with using Connector for SCEP, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/scep-connector.htmlc4scep-considerations-limitations.html">Considerations and Limitations</a>.</p> <p>If you provide an <code>IntuneConfiguration</code>, Connector for SCEP creates a connector for use with Microsoft Intune, and you manage the challenge passwords using Microsoft Intune.

Therefore, if you call <code>CreateChallenge</code> multiple times with the same client token within five minutes, Connector for SCEP recognizes that you are requesting only one challenge and will only respond with one.
